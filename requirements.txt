# Visual Snake Game Requirements
# This project uses only Python built-in modules for maximum compatibility

# Core Dependencies (Built-in modules):
# - os (Operating system interface)
# - time (Time-related functions)
# - random (Generate random numbers)
# - msvcrt (Windows-specific console I/O)
# - enum (Support for enumerations)

# flake8>=3.8.0          # For code linting
# black>=21.0.0          # For code formatting
# mypy>=0.800            # For type checking
